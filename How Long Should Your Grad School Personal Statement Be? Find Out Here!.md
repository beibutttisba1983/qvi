Read on for expert advice on crafting the perfect statement length that will set you apart from the competition!

## What is the Ideal Length for a Grad School Personal Statement?

Determining the **perfect length** for your grad school personal statement can be tricky. While every school has different requirements, most programs suggest anywhere between **500 to 1,000 words** for your personal statement. So, how do you know what to aim for?

Here are a few things to consider:

- **School Guidelines:** Always check the specific guidelines given by each grad school. Many programs have set word or character limits that you must adhere to.
